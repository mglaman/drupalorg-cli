A command line tool for interfacing with Drupal.org. Uses the Drupal.org REST API.

## Requirements

* PHP 8.1 or higher, with cURL support
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Currently required to apply and create patches. Very useful for contributing patches back to an issue.

## Installation

### Installing manually

1. Download the `drupalorg.phar` file from the [latest releases](https://github.com/mglaman/drupalorg-cli/releases/latest).
 
   Mac:
   ```bash
   curl -OL https://github.com/mglaman/drupalorg-cli/releases/latest/download/drupalorg.phar
   ```
   Linux:
   ```bash
   wget -O drupalorg.phar https://github.com/mglaman/drupalorg-cli/releases/latest/download/drupalorg.phar
   ```
   
2. Rename the file to `drupalorg`, ensure it is executable, and move it into a directory in your PATH (use `echo $PATH` to see your options).
   ```bash
   chmod +x drupalorg.phar
   ```

   ```bash
   sudo mv drupalorg.phar /usr/local/bin/drupalorg
   ```

3. Run `drupalorg` and verify you can see the list of available commands.

### Installing via Composer (deprecated)

Use the following command to install the command line tool via Composer:

`composer global require mglaman/drupalorg-cli`

### Installing (Bash) completion

`drupalorg` comes with completion support for all commands, excluding options.

To activate it, either source the completion file or add it to the system-wide completion directory, normally `/etc/bash_completion.d/`.

In your `.bashrc` (or `.profile`) add

```
source [...]/vendor/mglaman/drupalorg-cli/drupalorg-cli-completion.sh
```

## Updating

Automatic updating is not yet supported. You will need to manually download new releases.

## Usage

Use the 'list' command to see available commands. 

```
drupalorg list
```

## Getting Started

### Working with project issues

If you want to use this to generate patches that you can contribute back to a Drupal project, it's best to work within a cloned repo of that project. To get instructions for cloning a project's repo, visit the "Version Control" tab on the project page.

From within the directory of the project we're working on:

* `drupalorg issue:apply [issue number]` - Create a new branch for the given issue, apply the latest patch on the issue to the new branch, then commit the changes locally.
* `drupalorg issue:patch [issue number]` - Create a new patch for the given issue from the changes committed locally.

## Contributing

### Installing and running from source

1. Clone the repository
2. In the drupalorg-cli directory, run `composer install`
3. Run the script with `./drupalorg`
